This is a system identification pipeline for SISO systems. It includes:
- Input data analysis and detrending,
- Frequency response identification (using different Spectral Analysis (averaged, windowed)),
- System structure identification:
  - Order estimation,
  - Delay estimation,
  - n and m order.
- Model identification (ARX, IV4, OE, ARMAX, BJ, N4SID),
- Model validation (Time domain, frequency domain, statistical)
